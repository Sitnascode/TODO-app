# TODo-app — small static To‑Do list

This is a tiny, dependency-free single page To‑Do app.

How to run locally (quick):

```powershell
# from repository root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

What I added:

- `index.html` — updated body with a responsive, enthusiastic UI
- `style.css` — modern, colorful styles
- `app.js` — vanilla JS: add / edit / toggle / delete tasks + localStorage

Notes:

- No build step required. Files are static. Edit `style.css` or `app.js` to change the look or feature set.

If you want a different color palette, a remote font, or animations like confetti, tell me and I can add them.
